    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p class="effective-date">Effective date: December 2025</p>

    <p>
      Memlum ("we", "our", or "us") respects your privacy and is committed 
      to protecting it through this Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <div class="privacy-highlight">
      <p>
        <strong>Your recordings stay private on your device.</strong>
        All audio and video recordings are stored locally on your device and never transmitted to our servers.
      </p>
    </div>
    
    <h3>Data Stored Locally (On Your Device)</h3>
    <p>
      The following data is stored only on your device and never shared:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Audio and video recordings</li>
      <li>Recording titles and metadata</li>
      <li>Recording file paths and durations</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>Data Stored in Cloud (Firestore)</h3>
    <p>
      To enable sharing questions with family members, we store the following information in our cloud database (Firestore):
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Question text (the questions you ask or receive) - <strong>encrypted</strong></li>
      <li>Names (the names you provide when asking or answering questions) - <strong>encrypted</strong></li>
      <li>Question status (whether a question has been answered)</li>
      <li>Anonymous identifiers (random IDs generated per app installation to link questions and answers)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      <strong>Important:</strong> Your actual recordings (audio/video files) are never stored in the cloud. Question text and names are encrypted using AES-256-GCM encryption before being stored in Firestore. The encryption keys are stored only on your device and the recipient's device, meaning <strong>only the question sender and receiver can decrypt and read the question text and names</strong>. We (the developers) cannot read this encrypted data.
    </p>
    
    <h3>Anonymous Usage Data</h3>
    <p>
      We may collect anonymous usage data (such as which features you use most, app performance metrics, and general usage patterns) to improve the app's performance and features. This data does not include any personal recordings or identifiable information.
    </p>

    <h2>How We Use Your Data</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Question and Name Data:</strong> Question text and names stored in Firestore are encrypted and used solely to enable the question-sharing feature, allowing family members to send and receive questions through the app. Because the data is encrypted and we do not have access to the decryption keys, we cannot read the question text or names.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Anonymous Usage Data:</strong> Helps us understand how people use Memlum and improve the app experience. No personal recordings or identifiable content is included.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Recordings:</strong> Your audio and video recordings remain on your device and are never transmitted to our servers or shared with third parties.
    </p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>
      The app requires permission to use your device's microphone and camera 
      only to record audio and video. These recordings are stored locally on your device 
      and never transmitted to our servers unless you explicitly choose to share them 
      using your device's native sharing features.
    </p>

    <h2>Your Rights and Choices</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Recordings:</strong> You have full control over your recordings. You may delete, 
      edit, or share recordings at any time. Recordings remain on your device and are never 
      automatically synced to the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Question Data:</strong> Questions and names stored in Firestore are associated 
      with your device. You can delete questions you've asked directly in the app. Questions 
      you've received can be dismissed from your view, though they may remain accessible to 
      the person who asked them.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Data Deletion:</strong> You can delete recordings and questions you've asked 
      directly in the app at any time. If you need to delete other data or have questions about 
      data deletion, please contact us.
    </p>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use industry-standard security measures to protect data stored in Firestore. 
      All data transmission is encrypted using HTTPS. Question text and names are encrypted 
      using AES-256-GCM encryption before being stored in Firestore. Encryption keys are stored 
      only on user devices (never in Firestore), ensuring that only the question sender and 
      receiver can decrypt and read the content. Your recordings stored locally on your device 
      are protected by your device's security features.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      We use Firebase (Google) to store question and name data in Firestore. Firebase 
      is subject to Google's privacy policy. We do not use third-party services to collect, 
      store, or process your audio or video recordings.
    </p>
